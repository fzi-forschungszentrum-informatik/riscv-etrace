# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. Its format
is based on https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/.

## Unreleased

### Added

- `instruction::elf::Elf` fn for querying its `instruction::base::Set`.
- Convenience construction methods for `instruction::Kind`.
- Support for decoding RV64I instructions.
- Support for 64bit ELF files (as RV64I).
- Type `instruction::base::Set` for specifying a base instruction set (e.g.
  RV32I).
- A fn `instruction::Bits::decode` for instruction base set aware decoding
  `Bits` into `Kind`.

### Changed

- Make `instruction::Instruction::extract` take an `instruction::base::Set`
  parameter.
- Moved decoding fns `instruction::Kind::decode_16` and `decode_32` to
  `instruction::base::Set`.

### Removed

- `From<instruction::Bits>` impl for `instruction::Instruction`.

### Fixed

- Read `ecause` field in spike traces as hex values in simple example.

## 0.1.0 - 2025-05-19

### Added

- Initial version of the `riscv-etrace` library, featuring a decoder, tracer
  and specialized instruction database with limited instruction decoding
  functionality.
- A simple example tracer.
