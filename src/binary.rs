//! Binaries containing [`Instruction`]s
//!
//! Tracing requires knowledge about the program being traced. This module
//! defines the [`Binary`] trait used by the [`Tracer`][super::tracer::Tracer]
//! for retrieving [`Instruction`]s as well as a number of types implementing
//! the [`Binary`] trait. These include:
//!
//! * some [basic] [`Binary`]s such as adapters that may be created through
//!   free fns such as [`from_fn`] and [`from_segment`] and allow defining
//!   [`Binary`]s from a wide range of types supplying data,
//! * [combinators] that allow tracing multiple programs or program parts such
//!   as a firmware and an appliction,
//! * modifiers such as [`Offset`] that are usually created through provided fns
//!   of the [`Binary`] trait and
//! * feature-dependent [`Binary`]s, e.g. for using [ELF][elf] files as
//!   [`Binary`]s.
//!
//! # Combining [`Binary`]s
//!
//! Usually, [`Binary`]s used in [combinators] all need to agree on the
//! [`Binary::Error`] type. Combinators such as [`Multi`] in particular also
//! requires the [`Binary`]s themselves to be of the same type. If the `alloc`
//! feature is enabled, the error type may be erased through the provided method
//! [`Binary::boxed`]. The lifetime of the original [`Binary`] is preserved in
//! the resulting [`BoxedBinary`]. This is relevant when using an [`elf::Elf`]
//! or when...
//!
//! # Sharing [`Binary`]s between [`Tracer`] instances
//!
//! [`Binary`]s are intended for use by a single [`Tracer`] and can not be
//! easily shared between instances. They may be mutated when fetching an
//! [`Instruction`], e.g. for caching purposes. For example, a [`Multi`] will
//! remember the [`Binary`] it chooses and pick that particular one first the
//! next time.
//!
//! Sharing a [`Binary`] between [`Tracer`]s by placing them behind a mutex of
//! some kind defeates the caching, incurs considerable overhead and is highly
//! discouraged. Instead, users should consider sharing the data backing the
//! [`Binary`]s. For example, a [`basic::Segment`] may be created from a shared
//! buffer or [`Arc`][alloc::sync::Arc] and then cloned.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! The following constructs a [`Binary`] from a firmware image and a bootrom
//! and clones it for use by a second [`Tracer`] instance.
//!
//! ```
//! use riscv_etrace::binary::{self, Binary, Multi};
//! use riscv_etrace::instruction::base;
//!
//! # let bootrom = b"\x97\x02\x00\x00\x93\x85\x02\x02\x73\x25\x40\xf1\x83\xb2\x82\x01\x67\x80\x02\x00";
//! # let firmware = b"\x97\x02\x00\x00\x93\x82\x02\x00\x73\xa0\x52\x30\x73\x00\x50\x10\x6f\xf0\xdf\xff";
//! let binary1 = Multi::new([
//!     binary::from_segment(bootrom, base::Set::Rv32I).with_offset(0x1000),
//!     binary::from_segment(firmware, base::Set::Rv32I).with_offset(0x80000000),
//! ]);
//! let binary2 = binary1.clone();
//! ```
//!
